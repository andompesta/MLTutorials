# Basic RL value optimization algorithm

Implementation of a 2D maze enviroment with hols.
Test the difference between Q-learning and Sarsa algorithm.

The implementaiton is in pure numpy since only a recursive update rules is used to update the action-value function.

## Enviroment
l. maze_env_tinker is an online implementation of the enviroments
l. maze_env_gif is an implementation of the enviroment that generate anumated gif
